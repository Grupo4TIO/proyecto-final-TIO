Safety

New York City has kind of a bad reputation, but
is actually the safest large city in the States. The
police are present at most places tourists usually
venture to and can give you directions, so don’t
be afraid to ask. In general, you should always be
aware of your location. Some of the districts in
Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens might be shady, but
you can always inform yourself about the safety
of particular neighborhoods on the number 311.

When walking around after dark, stick to the main
streets. When riding the subway in the late night
hours, you might want to keep close to the con-
ductor’s car.

As in other cities, you will want to avoid scams.
Only use licensed taxis (especially when leaving
the airport) and businesses. Look out for the
street vendors selling knockoffs. If anyone is
bothering you, you can either completely ignore
them or just say a firm “no”, which deters even
the most persistent. New York, as any other large
city, unfortunately has its share of pickpockets.
