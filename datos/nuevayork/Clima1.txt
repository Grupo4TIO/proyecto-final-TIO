more informed and shop when it is most convenient
for them from whatever device they have on hand.

This power shift has carried over to the holiday
shopping season. While traditional holiday shopping
dates will experience spikes, their influence is waning.

Brands can no longer be dependent on a rigid
shopping calendar to optimize sales. Marketers must
connect with consumers when they are in the
right mindset.


2015 Lessons Learned

Although retail sales grew 3% in 2015 they fell
below expectations in large part due to mild
winter temperatures.

Despite strong sales volume, excess inventory
of seasonal items led to reduced prices and
lower profits.

 The results of December’s retail sales remind us just
         how significant of an impact unusual weather can

have on retail and overall economic activity.                         

                     mild temperatures              into the holiday spirit


Extremely harsh winters are
equally challenging for marketers
who are challenged to mitigate
the risk of poor travel conditions,
distribution delays and consumer
frustration.

For example, in 2014 when Boston was hit by
unusually heavy snow that derailed transportation
and shut down stores, businesses lost millions. In fact,
it’s estimated that losses totaled $10 million each day
stores were closed. Boston is not alone.

More recently in October of 2015 devastating floods
hit South Carolina resulting in an estimated net loss
of $390 million in economic output.

The are three
ingredients necessary
for delivering
advertising messages
at the optimal time.

1.	Location: Where is the
   consumer located? Is their
   proximity close to your
   location?

2.	Mood: How is the buyer
   feeling?

3.	Attention: Is the
   shopper likely to see my
   promotional content?

When all three intersect,
targeted messages drive
consumer action.

2016 Holiday Forecast

Nationally the November/December 2016 period
will be significantly colder and more winter like
than 2015.

EAST: The more seasonably typical winter weather will lead to much
stronger demand for all things winter including outerwear, footwear, outdoor
consumables, indoor activities and healthcare products (cold/flu). This will
represent a very long and pronounced demand trend when compared to the
same period last year.

WEST: Weaker demand for all things winter will be difficult to compare to last
year’s relatively cold and wet winter conditions. Demand will be higher for non
seasonal items and even outdoor activities. Electronics, toys, non-seasonal gift
giving will all see stronger demand trends as demand for seasonal products
lags last year’s very strong demand conditions.

6 steps to building
A winning
strategy for 2016

Consumers make shopping
decisions based on physical and
emotional responses to weather
conditions


STEP 1:

Expect Early Shoppers

In the Midwest & East

November and December 2016 will be significantly
colder and more wintry than 2015 across much of
the country and particularly in the Midwest and East.

Christmas week and the 2 weeks before Christmas
should be colder than last year, feeling much more
traditionally like Winter, and will likely put consumers
into the Holiday mood earlier than last year.

The West may see less of an early spike as they
experience a mildly warmer holiday season given the
cold, wet winter of 2015.


STEP 2:

Stock Inventory
to Predicted
Demands

Expect strong demand for
traditional winter seasonal
items including:

• Apparel & footwear

• Cold weather accessories

• Cold weather sporting goods

• Cold weather home improvement products

• Beer, Wine & Spirits


STEP 3:

Align campaigns by location

weather patterns at their location. In Arizona, a 65-degree day calls
for toasty cover, while in South Dakota it’s not until 51 degrees that
sweaters are likely to be used.

The same principal applies for all types of seasonal items. The most
effective marketers will trigger campaigns based on the consumers’
local context.
