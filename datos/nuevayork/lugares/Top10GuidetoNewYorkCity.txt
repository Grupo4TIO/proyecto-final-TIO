  The Top 10 Guide to New York

                Welcome to New York City.

            New York City is one of the great cities of the world. Powerful, dy-
            namic, pulsating with life, New York has been the inspiration of art-
            ists and writers, entrepreneurs and titans. It is where the wealthy
            make deals, performers make their mark, and romantics make love.
            New York is one of the most exciting cities to visit and to live in.
            There is more to see and do in just a few blocks of New York than in
            most other cities of the world combined. What a disappointment it
            would be to visit New York City and not experience the very best the
            city has to offer.

            makes sure you experience the city’s crown jewels: the great muse-
            ums, the dramatic panoramas, the romantic restaurants, the hot dis-
            cos, and the world famous New York City restaurants.

            New York for most visitors means Manhattan. Even for New Yorkers
            Manhattan is where the action is. This guide focuses on Manhattan
            as the key to a great New York experience.

7. Theatre
    Broadway
    There is only one Broadway. It is the standard for excellence
    around the world. “A Broadway show” says it all—
    glamorous, polished, dramatic, complete. Any serious theatre
    person must come to Broadway and the surrounding theatre
    scene. It is the toughest arena to break into; and when you
    do, it’s even tougher to reach stardom. Check out Broadway
    and Off Broadway (where union rules are sometimes the only
    difference) and Off-Off Broadway where tomorrow’s stars are
    testing their skills in more avant-garde productions. If you
    can make it here, you can make it anywhere.

8. Performing Arts
    Lincoln Center
    New York is the richest performing arts center in the world,
    maintaining the greatest diversity of dance, opera, and
    concerts anywhere. The performances are scattered about
    Manhattan, but mostly on the West Side. If you want to see
    the venues of the world’s best performing artists check out
    Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall. At Lincoln Center, you’ll
    see the young ballet dances gracefully walking about, serious
    musicians heading to practice with their instruments in tow,
    and composers and directors deep in thought. There are
    plenty of restaurants in the Center and the environs. Be sure
    to check out the Lincoln Center library with the world’s largest
    collection of performing arts materials.

9. Art
    57th St., Madison Ave., and SoHo
    You’ll find more original art, more art bought and sold, and
    more starving and prosperous artists in New York than
    anywhere in the world. Art is big business in New York. At
    the high end, check out the galleries along 57th Street and
    upper Madison Avenue. For the contemporary, hot artists, go
    to the galleries in SoHo.

10. Real Estate
    The biggest business of them all, it is quiet, boring, and
    unglamorous in a noisy, exciting, and glamorous city. But
    remember this: as you walk down endless streets upon streets
    of buildings, every inch of every floor of every building is
    owned by someone. And, yes, they’re doing very well, thank
    you.

   Can children enjoy a visit to New York? You bet they can! It is        not only your child but you as well. Be prepared to buy
   full of sights and sounds they will never see anywhere else.           something, though, it’s hard to leave empty-handed and the

1. Take them to a Broadway Show.                                      9. Take in a zoo.
    The memory will stay with them forever. With Disney now on            The Bronx Zoo is by far the best choice, but for a closer

2. Visit the Museum of Natural History.                                   It’s one of the great carousels of the world.
    This museum’s huge skeletons of dinosaurs and interactive
    displays amaze children. Kids love this place. See: The Top
    10 Museums for Children.

3. Go to the top of the Empire State Building.
    It provides breathtaking views of the city from over 1000 feet.
    Its open-air observatory on the 86th floor is refreshing and has
    been featured in “tons” of movies. Take your children’s
    picture with the city in the background. It’s the best “I did
    New York” photo.

4. Visit the Statue of Liberty.
    The boat trip into the New York Harbor is as exciting as the
    actual statue. See: The Top 10 New York City Must-See
    Areas.

5. Explore Radio City Music Hall.
    Awesome is one word that comes to mind. The building was
    designed to be impressive due to its immense size. There is
    just no theatre or show like it and the overwhelming
    magnitude of everything is dazzling.

6. Take the NBC tour.
    It’s always interesting to see where television shows come
    from.

7. Take a Double Decker Tour ride.
    The different perspective will keep them and you mesmerized.

9. Rest Rooms.
    Always a problem for tourists. A tip: the best rest rooms are
    in hotels. They are very public, usually clean and no hassle to
    use. In New York, you are never very far from a hotel. So, if
    you are getting concerned, set your sights on the nearest
    hotel and go refresh yourself.

10. Major Transportation terminals
    There are three major transportation centers in Manhattan.
    The Port Authority Building, Penn Station and Grand Central
    Station. The Port Authority handles almost all the busses
    coming in and going out of the Manhattan. Located between
    40th and 42nd Streets on Eight Avenue, it is a center of activity
    24 hrs a day. Buses to the three major NY airports depart from
    here; New York Airport Service to JFK and LaGuardia and
    New Jersey Transit Airport Express to Newark Airport.

    Just a few blocks away, is Penn Station (W. 31st to 33rd on
    Seventh Avenue) where Amtrak operates most of its trains.
    You can get a train there for Boston, Washington, Florida and
    all points in between. It is also a major commuter train center
    for Long Island and New Jersey.

    Grand Central Station, located on the East Side on 42nd Street,
    is the center for commuter trains to Connecticut and upstate
    New York. A few Amtrak trains also depart from here. Just
    outside Grand Central Station on Park Ave and 42nd Street is
    the Airport Bus Center with busses that go to JFK and
    LaGuardia.

    Coming into the city from JFK and LaGuardia airports, New
    York Airport Service (the most efficient and hassle-free way
    from the airports) deliver passengers to Grand Central and the
    Port Authority. From Newark Airport, New Jersey Transit goes
    to the Port Authority.
