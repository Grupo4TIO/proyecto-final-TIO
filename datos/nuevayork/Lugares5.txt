New York state

New York City needs little introduction, but the state that is home
to this world renowned city is relatively undiscovered, and with a
huge array of attractions away from the bright lights and round the
clock activity of the city. The ‘Upstate’ experience has something for
everyone and some of the most dramatic places in the United States.

The 1000 Islands region offers endless shorelines, rich history and unique
culture along the shores of the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario.
Lighthouses, historic castles, maritime museums, trophy fishing and
diving, quaint villages and waterfront dining make the 1000 Islands a
destination that visitors come to again and again.

Just 90 minutes east of Niagara Falls, Rochester is your base for visits to
the nearby Finger Lakes and Genesee Valley regions. A haven for arts and
culture, the delights of the fall foliage and garden tours, plus the chance to
cruise, walk, run, bike or paddle the Erie Canal. Visit the Corning Museum
of Glass where you can explore glass from all perspectives through works
of art, stained glass, modern glass innovations and even make your own.

Experience Niagara Falls with a trip aboard the famous Maid of the Mist,
and a breath taking encounter on the Cave of the Winds tour. Explore the
oldest state park in the USA, then take the Whirlpool Jet Boat in Lewiston
through “class five” rapids. There’s so much to see and do in Niagara USA!
Spend a couple of nights in Buffalo to visit the Albright Knox Art Gallery
which has a magnificent collection of modern art, including works by
Leger and Picasso. Visit Frank Lloyd Wright’s Darwin Martin House and the
Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site.

Central New York is characterised by diverse cities and village charm.
Visit historic Revolutionary War sites, enjoy Broadway theatre, opera,
sports history at Baseball and Boxing Halls of Fame, exquisite B&Bs and
luxury hotels; entertainment at Vegas-style casinos, scenic railways, craft
breweries, distilleries, and farm tours.

See and do it all in New York state, whether it’s outdoor activities such as
hiking, biking, canoeing, rafting, golf or skiing; sightseeing at some of the
magnificent mansions on the Hudson River or enjoying the view at Niagara
Falls or in the Adirondack Mountains; sampling culinary delights or some
of the region’s fine wines you will find plenty to fill a two week holiday or as
a shorter add-on to a New York City break.

It is a year round destination with great weather, lake beaches and outdoor
activities in the summer, fabulous Autumn colours in September and
October, Spring flowers in late April and May, and plenty of snow in the
winter for skiing and other winter activities.

We have put together the following holiday ideas to give you a sense of
what you can see and do in New York state.
