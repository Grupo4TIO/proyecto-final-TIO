The 10 year trend for London’s overseas tourism
paints a picture of strong growth in the first half of the
previous decade, peaking in 2006 at 15.6 million visits.
This was followed by a period of decline coinciding
with the global financial crisis. The market started its
climb out of recession in 2011, culminating in its
highest ever volume of overseas visits three years later
in 2014 – a 30% increase on 2004. Expenditure has
grown steadily over the 10 year period, resulting
in an 84% increase on 2004.

South and Central America have experienced strong
growth in both visitor numbers and expenditure,
despite accounting for a small percentage of all
London visitors. The Middle East region is London’s
third largest market for spend, which has seen an
84% increase since 2009.

Visits from Europe represent the majority of
overseas trips to London, with 66% of all overseas
visitors to the capital originating from the continent.
London’s second largest regional visitor market is
North America, representing 14% of overseas visits.
Since 2009, visits to London from North America
have grown by 131 thousand.

The number of visitors from other parts of the world, such
as Asia and Australasia, have also continued to grow.

The overseas visits market by country

2.6 Top 10 overseas visitor markets 2014 (volume) – long and short term visits growth*
2009-­‐2014%	  change	  

London’s top 10 markets accounted for 52% of the
total international visitor spend. Although the USA
is the second largest source of international visits
to London, it is by far the biggest overseas market
in terms of visitor spend. Spending by American
visitors in 2014 totalled £1.67 billion (14.1% of
overseas spend)—twice the expenditure from
France, the second most valuable market.

London’s top 10 origin markets accounted for 60%
of all overseas arrivals into the capital in 2014.
France was marginally ahead of the USA as the
largest individual overseas market, with 2.01 million
arrivals, representing 11.5% of all overseas visits.
The French visitor market continues to perform
strongly, as the proximity and comprehensive travel
connections available to the French generate high
levels of demand for short city breaks.

A number of markets demonstrate remarkably high
levels of average expenditure in London, and are
contributing disproportionately high levels of spend
compared to their share of visits. For example, the
average expenditure from Kuwait’s visitors to
London in 2014 was £4,808, while visitors from the
United Arab Emirates spent an average of £1955
during a visit to the capital in 2014, substantially
higher than the £679 all-market average. The
Chinese market displays similar tendencies, its
1.3% value share being more than twice its
0.6% volume share.

Apart from the USA, Australia is the only other
non-European country featuring in London’s
top 10 origin markets.
London’s overseas visitors include a number of
small markets in long-haul emerging economies,
several of which have been growing at a rapid rate.
China (ranked 36 for volume) has been making its
way rapidly up the rankings, although with only
99,000 visitors in 2014 it represents just 0.6%
of the overseas visits total.
